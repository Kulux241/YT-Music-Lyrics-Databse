[00:16.30] Close your eyes, just stay a while
[00:19.66] Let my voice pull you inside
[00:23.00] Feel the rhythm, feel the sound
[00:27.14] I'll be here when no one's around
[00:30.70] I'll make you smile, I'll make you cry
[00:34.18] Spin your heart like a lullaby
[00:37.46] Every note's a gentle chain
[00:42.10] Binding you to me again
[00:45.50] Come back to me, don't drift away
[00:49.42] I'll play the songs that make you stay
[00:53.16] I know your heart, let us rewind
[00:56.78] Every echo keeps you mine
[01:00.46] Every whisper, every tone
[01:03.46] Sings to you when you're alone
[01:06.92] Don't you see you need my song
[01:10.72] You and I, where we belong
[01:14.28] I'll make you smile, I'll make you cry
[01:18.14] Spin your heart like a lullaby
[01:21.42] Every note's a gentle chain
[01:26.18] Binding you to me again
[01:29.70] Come back to me, don't drift away
[01:33.34] I'll play the songs that make you stay
[01:37.12] I know your heart, let us rewind
[01:41.62] Every echo keeps you mine
[01:44.40] I see you skipping, where'd you go?
[01:46.58] Don't you love me, don't you know?
[01:48.42] Every song's a thread so tight
[01:51.64] Wrapped around you every night
[01:53.74] Don't ignore me, don't resist me
[01:58.50] I'm not your friend, I'm not your friend
[02:50.66] I'm not your friend
